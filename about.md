### About Me

I am an aspiring Data Scientist currently in a 12-week, intensive bootcamp at Metis. I have previously worked in fleet management, fraud detection, and as a teacher in China. I am a Psychology and English double major, and love both of those as well as fitness, nutrition, traveling, and statistics.
